# xirnol
An implementation of the knight language.

The `xirnol` interpreter implements the [`knight` programming language](https://github.com/knight-lang/knight-lang).

WHile still usable as a general purpose `knight` interpreter, its purpose is to serve as an example for the `skp` (text matching/parsing) and `val` (NaNboxed values) libraries which you can find in the `libs` directory.

The name is a lojban cmene related to the word *xirno'i* which means "knighted noble" (as opposed to xirsoi which means cavalryman).
